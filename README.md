# html-portfolio

<p>
This is overall a personal project which consists of smaller projects that I have created as part of a course I'm pursuing. The projects are mostly from html, css and javascript. A few have been made using basic React. I have combined all my projects and turned them into a portfolio, which I have created using basic html, css and javascript that I learnt. I created a simple design for the portfolio to show the progress I have made so far.
